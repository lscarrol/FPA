# FPA
Forex (Short Term) Prediction Algorithm 


## Basic Introduction    

We will use the Xignite Forex Data API for real-time rates from all central banks and for tick level analysis. We will
use APO-SMA, BBANDS, RSI and ADX indicator models. 

## Implementation

We will use a MNN, FNN, Radial Basis and possibly Kohonen models and compare error percentages.

### Linear Regression Tests

We will be looking for a 70% prediction rate final, with above a 45% in prelims.

### TODOS

```
12/21/18 Compare technical indicators, begin to build MNN
12/22/18 Run first prelims on MNN
1/28/18  Finish building Radial Basis, have dataset from MNN tests
```
